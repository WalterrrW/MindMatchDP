ToDo:
Initial:
	- login/register
	- answer questions
	- send/ store cnp
	- set profile (description so on)

Further:
	- MIND MATCH - algo to find closest friends (ex 25)
	- option 1: send all 25 profiles to front-end as a list of Json objects
	- option 2: send just one by one, as the user request another profile

Final: 
	- open chat between 2 users:
	- maybe video streaming between those
